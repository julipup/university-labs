# Write a program for selling tickets to IT-events.
# Each ticket has a unique number and a price. There
# are four types of tickets: regular ticket,
# advance ticket (purchased 60 or more days before the event),
# late ticket (purchased fewer than 10 days before the
# event) and student ticket.
#
# Additional information:
# -advance ticket - discount 40% of the regular ticket price;
# -student ticket - discount 50% of the regular ticket price;
# -late ticket - additional 10% to the regular ticket price.
#
# All tickets must have the following properties:
# -the ability to construct a ticket by number;
# -the ability to ask for a ticketâ€™s price;
# -the ability to print a ticket as a String.

# Ticket types:
# 1 - Regular ticket
# 2 - Advance ticket
# 3 - Late ticket
# 4 - Student ticket
